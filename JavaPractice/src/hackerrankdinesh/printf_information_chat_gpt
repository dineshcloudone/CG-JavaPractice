`printf` is a method in Java that allows you to format and print text in a specific way. It stands for "print formatted", and it's part of the `PrintStream` class, typically used with `System.out` to print output to the console.

Here's a breakdown of how to use `printf`:

1. **Format String**: The first argument of `printf` is a format string. This string specifies how the output should be formatted. It contains plain text along with format specifiers, which start with `%`. Each specifier is replaced by the value of an argument.

2. **Format Specifiers**: Format specifiers indicate where and how to insert the values of additional arguments. Common format specifiers include:
   - `%s`: Insert a string.
   - `%d`: Insert a decimal integer.
   - `%f`: Insert a floating-point number.
   - `%c`: Insert a character.
   - `%b`: Insert a boolean value.
   - `%n`: Insert a newline character.

3. **Width and Precision**: You can specify the width and precision of the output. For example, `%5s` specifies a field of width 5 characters for a string. `%10.2f` specifies a floating-point number with a total width of 10 characters, including 2 digits after the decimal point.

4. **Flags**: Flags modify the behavior of the format specifiers. For example:
   - `-`: Left-justify the output.
   - `+`: Always include a sign (+ or -) for numeric values.
   - `0`: Pad numeric values with leading zeros.
   - `,`: Use locale-specific grouping separators for numeric values.

5. **Additional Arguments**: After the format string, you provide additional arguments corresponding to the format specifiers. These arguments are inserted into the format string in the order they appear.

Here's an example demonstrating the usage of `printf`:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "John";
        int age = 30;
        double height = 5.8;

        System.out.printf("Name: %s, Age: %d, Height: %.1f feet%n", name, age, height);
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `%s` is replaced by the string variable `name`.
- `%d` is replaced by the integer variable `age`.
- `%.1f` specifies a floating-point number (`height`) with one digit after the decimal point.
- `%n` inserts a newline character.

When you run this program, it will print:
```
Name: John, Age: 30, Height: 5.8 feet
```
